# Travel Planner

This is our final school project where we decided to build an application called Travel Planner, an app that you can use when planning your next trip.

Our goal with this app was to make travel planning more fun and easier by keeping every part of the planning process in the same space.

We used Expo, React Native and Javacript.

This project was created by:
